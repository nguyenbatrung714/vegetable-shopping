Blogs in particular are great resources, as they&rsquo;re constantly updated with new recipes. Not only do these new recipes keep things exciting, but they also reflect what&rsquo;s happening&nbsp;<em>right now</em>, which helps me cook with the seasons.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re new to vegetarian cooking or just want to peruse some beautiful sites, here are the five vegetarian blogs I turn to again and again for endless inspiration and ideas.</p>

<h3>1.&nbsp;<a href="https://naturallyella.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">With Food and Love</a></h3>

<p>To me, being a vegetarian means celebrating all the food I&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;eat and not focusing on the things I no longer eat. Sherrie&rsquo;s blog perfectly captures this ethos. Her recipes, like the&nbsp;<a href="http://withfoodandlove.com/creamy-risotto-with-roasted-spring-vegetables/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">creamy risotto with roasted spring vegetables</a>&nbsp;pictured above, put fresh, in-season produce front and center. The stunning photos draw me in, but her vibrant, flavorful food is what keeps me coming back.</p>

<h3>2.&nbsp;<a href="https://naturallyella.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Naturally Ella</a></h3>

<p>You might recognize Erin as one of our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/authors/erinalderson">contributors</a>, but if not, I highly suggest you get to know her and her wonderful blog. Erin&rsquo;s recipes are great for new vegetarians (or people who are trying to incorporate more plant-based meals into their routine), as she covers the basic building blocks of this style of cooking. She also has plenty of inventive recipes like the&nbsp;<a href="https://naturallyella.com/spiced-sweet-potato-skewers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spiced sweet potato skewers with cilantro yogurt sauce</a>&nbsp;pictured above.</p>

<h3>3.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.101cookbooks.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">101 Cookbooks</a></h3>

<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be a vegetarian blog roundup without 101 Cookbooks. Heidi&rsquo;s blog is one of the first I obsessively followed when I made the switch to a meat-free diet, and I&rsquo;ve trusted her to guide me to delicious dishes ever since. The most notable trick I learned from her is to upgrade simple meals, like the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/a-simple-asparagus-soup-recipe.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asparagus soup</a>&nbsp;pictured above, with some fancy garnishes. Things like chive flowers, toasted marcona almonds, and lemon-ginger-rosemary butter make everyday recipes feel a bit more luxurious and special.</p>

<h3>4.&nbsp;<a href="http://cookieandkate.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cookie and Kate</a></h3>

<p>When cooking for non-vegetarian friends and family members, I often choose a recipe from Cookie and Kate. Without fail, her dishes always surprise and delight even the most skeptical carnivore. Case in point? I recently made her&nbsp;<a href="http://cookieandkate.com/2017/lentil-baked-ziti-recipe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lentil baked ziti</a>&nbsp;(pictured above), and it was a huge hit. No one missed the meat, and everyone asked for seconds.</p>

<h3>5.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.greenkitchenstories.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Green Kitchen Stories</a></h3>

<p>A misconception around vegetarian cooking is that it&rsquo;s not for people with busy lifestyles who don&rsquo;t have a lot of time to devote to cooking everything from scratch. David and Luise, the husband-and-wife team behind Green Kitchen Stories, prove this line of thinking wrong. (They have three kids to look after, so they know a thing or two about making healthy food on a hectic schedule). I&rsquo;ve had great luck lately with their&nbsp;<a href="http://www.greenkitchenstories.com/mint-chocolate-power-bars/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mint chocolate power bars</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.greenkitchenstories.com/our-3-favorite-quick-treats/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">berry &amp; tahini smoothie</a>&nbsp;pictured above.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://iheartvegetables.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Cream-Cheese-Fruit-Dip-1-of-7-680x1020.jpg" /></p>

<h2><strong>Ingredients &amp; Substitutions</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Cream cheese</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; This gives the dip its signature luscious texture. For something a little lighter, you can use low-fat cream cheese, Greek yogurt cream cheese, or vegan cream cheese.</li>
	<li><strong>Whipped topping</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; Keep in mind that this is different from whipped cream. Feel free to use vegan cocowhip if you prefer!</li>
	<li><strong>Powdered sugar</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; This will add sweetness to the fruit dip without making it grainy. If you only have granulated sugar, you can throw it in a blender and pulse for a few seconds to turn it into powdered sugar. In a pinch, you could substitute with brown sugar. It just won&rsquo;t be quite as smooth.</li>
	<li><strong>Vanilla extract</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; This adds a little more sweetness as well as depth of flavor.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What to Serve with Fruit Dip</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Fruits</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; Berries, bananas, kiwi, and apple slices are some of my favorites. Pretty much any fruit will be wonderful with this dip! Sliced apples are my favorite.</li>
	<li><strong>Fruit kabobs &mdash;&nbsp;</strong>These are especially great if you&rsquo;re entertaining! Use toothpicks or longer wooden skewers and add a variety of fruits on each one. The presentation turns out so cute.</li>
	<li><strong>Sweet dippers</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; Some tasty options include graham crackers, vanilla wafers, animal crackers,&nbsp;<a href="https://iheartvegetables.com/how-to-make-cinnamon-chips/">cinnamon chips</a>, and waffle cones. Or you could get a little fancy with some Italian pizzelle waffle cookies.</li>
	<li><strong>Salty dippers</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; Mini pretzels are always a crowd-pleaser and I love the sweet and salty combo!</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Can this Dip be Made in Advance?</strong></h2>

<p>You bet! In fact, you can make this recipe ahead of time and&nbsp;<strong>store the fruit dip for up to two days</strong>. This makes it great to have on hand for the next time your sugar cravings strike.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also nice if you plan to have friends or family over later and want to prep the fruit dip in advance. It makes such a delightful appetizer or dessert! I should mention here that you can double this recipe if need be. If you&rsquo;re sharing it with friends, I highly recommend making a double batch, or it will be gone before you know it!</p>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re making your cream cheese fruit dip ahead of time or simply can&rsquo;t finish an entire batch in one sitting, make sure to store the leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator. You could also cover a serving bowl with plastic wrap if that&rsquo;s easier. I don&rsquo;t recommend freezing this dip.</p>

<h2><strong>Variations</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Dial up that wonderful fruit flavor!&nbsp;<strong>Stir in 1-2 tablespoons of fruit preserves or jam</strong>&nbsp;to add another delicious element to your dip. Keep in mind that you may want to reduce the amount of powdered sugar you use so the dip doesn&rsquo;t turn out overly sweet.</li>
	<li><strong>Sprinkle in mini&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://iheartvegetables.com/chocolate-chip-cheesecake-dip/">chocolate chips</a>&nbsp;for a chocolatey twist. You could use dark chocolate, milk chocolate, or even rich white chocolate! I recommend serving with strawberries, raspberries, and other fruits that pair well with chocolate.</li>
	<li>You can use low fat cream cheese if you want to lower the fat content of this dip.</li>
	<li>For another flavor twist, try adding a&nbsp;<strong>drizzle of peanut butter</strong>&nbsp;or your other favorite nut butter on top!</li>
	<li>To add a pop of color and a little texture,&nbsp;<strong>stir in some chopped strawberries or raspberries</strong>&nbsp;or try using strawberry cream cheese!</li>
	<li>If your main fruit is going to be apple slices,&nbsp;<strong>add a sprinkle of cinnamon and a drizzle of honey</strong>&nbsp;on top! This will also be fantastic with graham crackers and vanilla wafers.</li>
	<li><strong>Mix in 2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder&nbsp;</strong>for a rich chocolate dip.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I like pairing this version with tart berries!</li>
</ul>

They are divided into groups based on nutritional content, such as dark green, starchy, and beans, peas, and lentils.</p>

<p>Most adults should aim for 2&ndash;4 cups of vegetables daily, depending on age and sex. Eating veggies every day can help you get more nutrients directly from food. They also help you feel full, making managing weight easier.1</p>

<p>This article covers some of the most nutrient-dense vegetables and their health benefits.</p>

<h2>Spinach</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/spinach-7503549">Spinach</a>&nbsp;is one of the most nutrient-rich&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/green-vegetables-7975333">green</a>&nbsp;leafy veggies you can eat.2&nbsp;It provides substantial amounts of vitamins A, B, and K. It&#39;s a good source of minerals, including manganese, magnesium, iron, copper, and calcium. Plus, it&#39;s rich in antioxidants, fiber, and essential amino acids.3</p>

<p>Spinach may help manage blood sugar and cholesterol levels and lower the risk of some cancers.4&nbsp;You may not want to eat spinach every day because doing so can make it hard to absorb calcium and magnesium, which may lead to kidney stones.2&nbsp;Its high amount of vitamin K can interfere with blood thinners and other medications.5</p>

<h2>Carrots</h2>

<p>This root vegetable provides an abundance of vitamin A. Carrots are a good source of beta carotene, potassium, fiber, antioxidants, vitamin K, and essential amino acids.6</p>

<p>Phytochemicals in carrots appear to have anti-cancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial effects.7&nbsp;You&#39;ll get more of the benefits of beta carotene from cooked carrots versus raw.8&nbsp;Eating many carotene-rich foods over several months can lead to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/carotenemia-7254408">carotenemia</a>, which makes your skin look yellow or orange.9</p>

<h2>Sweet Potatoes</h2>

<p>One medium skin-on baked&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/benefits-of-sweet-potatoes-7973361">sweet potato</a>&nbsp;provides 122% of the recommended daily value (DV) for vitamin A (based on a 2,000-calorie diet). Among other nutrients, they&#39;re also rich in vitamin C, fiber, potassium, B vitamins, beta carotene, and essential amino acids.10</p>

<p>Sweet potatoes may help lower the risks of developing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/sweet-potatoes-and-diabetes-5105171">diabetes</a>, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.11</p>

<h2>Broccoli</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/broccoli-benefits-7970509">Broccoli</a>&nbsp;is rich in fiber and vitamins A, C, and K and is a good calcium, potassium, and iron source. Broccoli has powerful antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties.12&nbsp;Raw or cooked, broccoli is a great way to get your greens.</p>

<p>Some research suggests that indole glucosinolate, a compound in cruciferous vegetables, interferes with thyroid hormones. But there isn&#39;t enough data to say how much you&#39;d have to eat to cause a problem.13</p>

<h2>Kale</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/raw-or-cooked-kale-8409188">Kale</a>&nbsp;is a good source of vitamins K, C, A, and B6, folate, and manganese. It&#39;s also high in fiber and carotenoids, lutein, and zeaxanthin.14</p>

<p>Antioxidants in kale help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. This leafy green may help with constipation or digestive problems. It may also protect against heart disease, cancer, and obesity. You&#39;ll get more nutritional value from raw kale as opposed to cooked kale.15</p>

<h2>Green Peas</h2>

<p>One cup of cooked&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/peas-8363876">green peas</a>&nbsp;has 31% of the DV for fiber. You&#39;ll also get generous amounts of protein and vitamins A, B, and C, plus iron and other important nutrients.16</p>

<p>Green peas and other pulses are low&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/glycemic-index-chart-for-common-foods-1087476">glycemic index</a>&nbsp;foods, which means they don&#39;t typically spike blood sugar. These veggies may help lower the risk of diabetes and heart disease.17&nbsp;Plus, the protein and fiber content of peas can help you feel full and control your appetite.</p>

<h2>Tomatoes</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/health-benefits-tomatoes-7644531">Tomatoes</a>, which are fruits, have plenty of vitamin C and other antioxidants. Tomatoes may help lower the risk of heart, neurodegenerative, and bowel diseases. And tomatoes are good for the immune system and skin.18</p>

<p>Known for abundant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/lycopene-health-benefits-4684446">lycopene</a>, which has anti-cancer properties, tomatoes are nutritious raw or cooked. But it&#39;s easier for the body to absorb lycopene from cooked tomatoes as opposed to raw.8</p>

<h2>Brussels Sprouts</h2>

<p>A serving of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/are-brussel-sprouts-good-for-you-8383689">Brussels sprouts</a>&nbsp;has about half the DV for vitamin C, along with other antioxidants. You also get lots of fiber, potassium, and folate. This cruciferous veggie promotes blood and bone health, supports the immune system, and may help prevent some cancers. They help you feel full but are low in calories. If you boil Brussels sprouts, you&#39;ll lose some vitamin C, so you might want to steam, roast, or saut&eacute; them.19</p>

<h2>Bell Peppers</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/bell-peppers-8387039">Bell peppers</a>&nbsp;are fruits, though most people use them as vegetables. They come in various colors, including green, yellow, orange, and red. They&#39;re all nutrient-dense, though nutritional value varies slightly according to color.</p>

<p>Bell peppers are rich in bioactive compounds with antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-diabetic, and anti-tumor properties. Plus, they&#39;re good for the immune system.20</p>

<h2>Onions</h2>

<p>Bioactive compounds in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/onion-7968418">onions</a>&nbsp;supply a host of health benefits. They have antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory effects. They may also protect against diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. And they&#39;re good for the digestive, immune, and reproductive systems.21</p>

<h2>Garlic</h2>

<p>Garlic owes most of its health benefits, including strong antioxidant properties, to an array of bioactive compounds. Garlic may help improve&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/can-garlic-lower-your-cholesterol-698110">cholesterol</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/can-garlic-beat-high-blood-pressure-3571761">blood pressure</a>. And its anti-inflammatory effects may help lower the risk of chronic diseases such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/garlic-reduces-your-cancer-risk-430030">cancer</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/type-2-diabetes-statistics-5214216">diabetes</a>, and cardiovascular disease.22</p>

<h2>Swiss Chard</h2>

<p>Swiss chard is a good source of vitamins A and C.23&nbsp;Swiss chard and other leafy greens have abundant antioxidants, which may help lower the risk of heart disease and some cancers. It also contains fiber, which can help with weight management and digestion.24</p>

<p>A cup of raw Swiss chard has 249% of the DV for vitamin K.23&nbsp;Vitamin K is important for bone health and blood clotting. However, it can interfere with blood thinners and other medications.25</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/healthy-diet-7974009">healthy, balanced diet</a>&nbsp;is rich in vegetables and fruits. When it comes to vegetables, some are more nutrient-dense than others. Each one provides a unique blend of healthy properties. You&#39;ll gain more health benefits by varying your veggies by color, texture, and flavor at every&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/principles-of-healthy-eating-2509639">meal</a>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go for local produce if possible as they tend to be fresher, higher in nutrients, and budget-friendly when in season,&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://cahnr.uconn.edu/person/sharon-gray/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sherry Gray, MPH, RD</a>, a registered dietitian and extension educator at the University of Connecticut, told Verywell in an email.</p>

<p>Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables maximizes heart health benefits and gives you a mix of antioxidants, Gray added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If [you&rsquo;re] not used to using vegetables and fruits in your diet, start by adding one or two to your day and increase from there,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Consider these 7 fruits and vegetables to boost your heart health this summer.</p>

<h2>Tomatoes</h2>

<p>Tomatoes are a nutrient-rich summer staple packed with heart-healthy nutrients like potassium and vitamin C.3&nbsp;Tomatoes also contain folate, which helps regulate blood levels of homocysteine, an amino acid that can contribute to heart disease risk, according to Gray.4</p>

<p>Research has associated lycopene, an antioxidant in tomatoes, with a lower risk of stroke and heart disease.5</p>

<p>Tomatoes come in several varieties, including plum, heirloom, green, cherry, and beefsteak, so look for different colors and sizes when shopping for tomatoes this summer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like to cook tomatoes in pasta and add fresh arugula, a little olive oil, and parmesan cheese,&rdquo; Gray said.</p>

<h2>Blueberries</h2>

<p>Summer berries, like blueberries and blackberries, contain anthocyanin pigments. These pigments provide anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits and may lower heart disease risk.6</p>

<p>Blueberries are a good source of fiber, which is a major focus area for heart health, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1750952271/heather-a-hodson" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heather A. Hodson, RDN, CDN, CDCES</a>, the clinical nutritionist for NYU Langone&rsquo;s Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease.</p>

<p>Hodson explained that blueberries offer additional benefits beyond heart health, including vitamin K, which supports blood clotting and bone building, and manganese, which aids immune and reproductive function.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the hot summer months, many of us turn to frozen treats to help cool off. Remember that fruit can be fabulous for this. Freeze chunks of cut-up fruit or blend and pour into popsicle molds for a sweet and fiber-filled dessert or snack,&rdquo; Hodson told Verywell in an email.</p>

<h2>Peaches</h2>

<p>Peaches, a summer stone fruit, are rich in potassium, vitamin C, and fiber. These nutrients help improve cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and protect against heart disease.7</p>

<p>This stone fruit also contains&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/beta-carotene-5496833">beta-carotene</a>, an antioxidant that gives peaches their signature yellow hue. Once converted into vitamin A in the body, it helps reduce heart disease risk.8</p>

<p>Peaches work well grilled or mixed into salsas. Hodson recommends adding peaches to summer fruit salads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep things simple by sticking to a few of your favorite fruits, or take this a step further by adding unexpected twists like seasonal fresh herbs,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<h2>Apricots</h2>

<p>Apricots, like peaches, are a summer stone fruit with antioxidants that help protect against coronary heart disease.9&nbsp;They also contain the fiber pectin, which acts as a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/constipation-remedies-89088">natural laxative</a>, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.nm.org/doctors/1801971049/bethany-marie-doerfler-rd__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!STMtlKfmztsbONN8UfBxxS0osgU3rDVqS13dPFYORc1TUiKZhB8-XrskbVLZa7FcIfO-T2epREG0G5Ne2NPFEj0JEwktrmAsaPAfMLUz$" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bethany Doerfler, RD</a>, a registered dietitian at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This summer sweet treat is packed with vitamins A, B, and C as well as phenolic compounds and carotenoids, which can improve blood vessel health,&rdquo; Doerfler told Verywell in an email.</p>

<p>To fully enjoy the sweetness of apricots, she recommends replacing your usual dessert with fresh apricots topped with cinnamon and yogurt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Substituting fruit for dessert is a positive lifestyle change that adds up to greater cardiovascular health,&rdquo; Doerfler said.</p>

<h2>Watermelon</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/benefits-of-watermelon-7498099">Watermelon</a>&nbsp;is a refreshing fruit with potassium, fiber, and lycopene, the same antioxidant found in tomatoes. Research has associated lycopene with improved blood pressure control and prevention of cardiovascular disorders.10&nbsp;Limited research suggests that&nbsp;L-citrulline, an amino acid in watermelon, can lower blood pressure and arterial stiffness.11</p>

<p>Many watermelon studies use supplements or extracts, so people would need to eat over two pounds of the raw fruit per day to reach similar amounts.12</p>

<p>However, Doerfler said all produce have vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients that support heart health. Hence, it is a good idea to add a variety of fruits, including watermelon, into your summer diet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try watermelon with pickled onions and a mild crumbled cheese like feta for a unique summer salad,&rdquo; Doerfler said.</p>

<h2>Zucchini</h2>

<p>Zucchini and other summer squash are a good source of potassium, an important mineral for managing blood pressure and lowering the risk of stroke and heart disease. Most Americans don&rsquo;t consume enough potassium, so focus on adding more zucchini and other potassium-rich produce to your diet this summer to support heart health.13</p>

<p>&ldquo;I personally love to roast vegetables, including zucchini and cabbage, whether on the grill outside, on a sheet pan in the oven, or in a skillet on the stove. I often will lightly spray with olive oil and add my favorite no-salt seasonings such as garlic, onion, pepper, parsley, dill, and ground mustard,&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/people/dawn-earnesty" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dawn Earnesty, PhD, RDN</a>, a registered dietitian and senior extension specialist at Michigan State University Extension, told Verywell in an email.</p>

<p>Earnesty said zucchini also contains vitamin C and fiber, which support healthy digestion and aid in removing cholesterol from the blood.</p>

<h2>Strawberries</h2>

<p>A small 2021 study found that consuming<strong>&nbsp;</strong>2.5 servings of strawberries per day helps improve cardiometabolic risk factors and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>insulin resistance.14</p>

<p>Strawberries contain antioxidants and vitamin C, which attack free radicals that can cause damage to your heart, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/melissa-ann-prest" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Melissa Ann Prest, DCN, RDN</a>, a registered dietitian based in Seattle and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.</p>

<p>Enjoy fresh strawberries on their own, blended into a smoothie, chopped in a salad, or as a topping for oatmeal or Greek yogurt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In general, we are not eating enough fruits and vegetables,&rdquo; Prest said in an email. &ldquo;Make a goal this summer to add a fruit or vegetable to at least two meals and one snack.&rdquo;</p>
